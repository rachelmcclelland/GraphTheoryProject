SHUNTING  YARD ALGORITHM
https://brilliant.org/wiki/shunting-yard-algorithm/
This algorithm was invented by Edsger Dijkstra. It is used for parsing mathematical expressions.
It uses the use of stacks to rearrange the operators and operands into the correct for for evaluation.
The procedure used is as follows:
    ->Expressions are parsed from the left side to the right side
    ->Each time a number or an operator is read, it is pushed to the stacks
    ->If an operator comes up, we pop the required operands from the stack, perform the operations, 
    and push the result back to the stack.
    ->We are finished when the string is empty

This website helped me figure out how to add the + operator into the compileToNFA function.

    how the alogorithm is used and it is also easy to follow
